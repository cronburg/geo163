\section{Algorithm \& Data Structures} \label{sec:algorithm}

The goal of this algorithm is to have average case constant time
visibility polygon updates in the presence of a moving visibility point. This
\py{UpdateVisibility} pseudocode gives a top-level view of what the
algorithm does:

\begin{minted}{python}
def UpdateVisibility(point): # O(1) on average
  move = Edge(point, point.nextPosition):
  # O(1) neighbors on average
  for neighbor in point.currDelaunay.neighbors:
    if Intersect(move, neighbor):
      return neighbor
  return point.currDelaunay
\end{minted}

This assumes we have a graph of Delaunay triangles, each of which have
associated with them $O(1)$ instructions for how to compute each of the
windows in their visibility polygon given the location of a point inside
the DT.

\subsection{UpdateVisibility Details}

In \py{UpdateVisibility} we are finding the Delaunay triangle (DT) that our
point is transitioning into by checking which neighboring DT
intersects with the point's segment of movement.

When the point moves from one DT to another we have one of two cases:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The new DT is inside the same convex \emph{visibility region}
    (see Figure~\ref{fig:visibility-regions}). In this
    case we need only recompute where the window points lay on the same
    edge they were on before. This can be done in $O(w)$ for $w$ window
    edges in the visibility region, which is necessarily $O(w) \in O(v)$
    for $v$ visibility polygon vertices. This is optimal because we must
    at least read off the $v$ vertices in the visibility solution. If on
    the other hand we did not need the visibility polygon for a particular
    time step, the runtime is $O(1)$ to move the point in our Delaunay
    graph.
  \item The new DT crosses a convex visibility region edge into a new
    region. Given general position, this transition requires the
    updating of exactly one edge / window in the visibility polygon
    which can be done online in $O(1)$. Again as in case $1$, we also
    recalculate where the windows land on their respective polygon
    edges in $O(w)$ time.
\end{enumerate}

    The visibility window (dashed line) passing through polygon vertex
    $a$ merges with the line segment $\overline{ab}$; i.e. the segment
    $\overline{ab}$ goes from being invisible to visible. Because of our
    general position and small motion assumptions, no two windows can
    change at the same time.

    The window in this figure is initially passing through $a$ and
    landing on the polygonal edge $\overline{bc}$. When we then move
    the point a short distance to the left, the window passes through
    point $c$ now landing on edge $\overline{de}$.

\subsection{Delaunay Justification} \label{sec:delaunay-justification}

We use DTs to ensure that we look at a constant number of edges
(neighboring DTs) for each visibility update. If we had
used the entire convex partitions of our polygon, we would be stuck
with an $O(\log n)$ average case as required by the visibility
complex of \cite{dynamic-visibility}. In the Section~\ref{sec:future}
we discuss possible theories for improving the time bound to be
$\theta(1)$ in all cases.

In order to get the DTs and build a meaningful graph of visibility
polygons from them, we have to first partition our polygon into
convex \emph{visibility regions} (Figure~\ref{fig:visibility-regions}).
Top-level code for this looks like:

\begin{samepage}
\begin{minted}{python}
def PrecomputeVisibility(polygon):
  delaunays = []
  visGraph  = VisibilityPartition(polygon)
  for convexPoly in visGraph:
    delaunays.append(DelaunayTriang(convexPoly))
  ds = LinkNeighbors(delaunays)
  ComputeVisibilities(polygon, ds)
  return ds
\end{minted}
\end{samepage}

\emph{VisibilityPartition} computes a list of convex polygons like the
ones shown in Figure~\ref{fig:visibility-regions}. These visibility
regions are then further partitioned into their Delaunay Triangulations
in the \emph{DelaunayTriang} method. Next we link neighboring
DTs in \emph{LinkNeighbors} forming a Delaunay graph. Finally
\emph{ComputeVisibilities} informs each of the nodes (DTs) in the
Delaunay graph how to compute the visibility polygon of a point inside
of it:

\begin{minted}{python}
def ComputeVisibilities(polygon, ds):
  for d in ds:
    ws = ComputeWindows(polygon, d)
    vs = VisibleEdges(polygon, d)
    d.visEdges = RadialSort(d, ws, vs)
    def GetVisPoly(position, d=d):
      visPoly = []
      for e in d.visEdges:
        if isWindow(e):
          AddWindow(visPoly, point, e)
        else: visPoly.append(e)
      return visPoly
    d.getVisPoly = GetVisPoly
\end{minted}

\emph{ComputeVisibilities} takes each DT in the DT-partitioning of
the polygon. For a DT, we precompute all the polygonal edges which
will be involved in a window as well as any edges fully visible from
inside the DT. We then radially sort these windows \& edges so that
when \emph{GetVisPoly} iterates over them the DTs will already be in
the correct order to form the visibility polygon (\emph{visPoly})
computed online. We then define the code \emph{GetVisPoly} for computing
a visibility polygon in $O(v)$ time ($v$ vertices in the visibility
polygon). Note that \emph{GetVisPoly} does not run until a point
requests its visibility polygon at runtime by calling
\py{point.currDelaunay.getVisPoly(point)} e.g. immediately after
\emph{UpdateVisibility} runs.

As just stated \emph{GetVisPoly} runs in $O(v)$ time, but the
actual visibility update (\emph{UpdateVisibility}) to know which
DT we are in took constant average time.

    Example decomposition of a polygon into convex
    \emph{visibility regions}. Highlighted (in green) is one such
    region. Transitioning from one region to another neighboring
    region changes at most the visibility of one edge or which edge
    a window lands on.

    Further decomposition of the visibility regions of
    Figure~\ref{fig:visibility-regions} into their respective
    Delaunay Triangulations. One such DT is highlighted in red
    which has two neighboring DTs. Note that a point movement from
    the red to yellow DT is possible, but this can be handled in
    constant time as two transitions using the purple DT as an
    intermediary.

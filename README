Computational Geometry Final Project
====================================

Comp 163 @ Tufts.

Currently you can select a chain of points to form a polygon
(which you must then close off). The chain polygon must be
simple. You can then place a point inside of the polygon to
be the guard, after which a visibility polygon is computed.
Clicking 'continue' then allows you to use the arrow keys to
move the guard around, adjusting the visibility polygon
accordingly.

Work TODO to finish project:
- second player
- explanation of an optimal dynamic visibility polygon algorithm?

Future Work:
- Zoom in/out of space with polygon
- Smooth guard velocity based on key press / release timing
- Save / load polygons
- Port to javascript
